# WaterEnergyDemandNexus
Code and data for an analysis of the water-energy demand nexus using climate analogs. The results from the analysis are currently in preparation for publication: 

Obringer, R., Knee, J., Kumar, R., Madani, K., and Nateghi, R. Using climate analogs to better understand the future of the urban water-energy nexus.

The code was developed in R version 4.0.2 and last ran on 8 March 2021. The code is contained in the file `climateanaloganalysis.R` and the associated Rdata files can be found in the `rdatafiles` folder. 

Two categories of data were collected: utility data and climate data. The utility data (folder: `UtilityData`) includes water and electricity use data obtained from local utilities. The climate data (folder: `ClimateData`) were obtained from the North American Regional Reanalysis. All data were collected in 2019.

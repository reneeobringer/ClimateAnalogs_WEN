Climate data were obtained from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). 

Variables included precipitation (mm), average air temperature (K), wet bulb temperature (degC), dew point temperature (K), realtive humidity (%), and wind speed (m/s).
Wind speed is broken down into u and v directions, to calculate wind speed: sqrt(u^2 + v^2)

Data were obtained for each day from January 2007 through December 2018 and aggregated to form minimum, average, and maximum monthly values.
